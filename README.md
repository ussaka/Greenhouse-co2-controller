The goal of this project is to control CO2 level in a greenhouse. The controller measures CO2 level and turn CO2 valve on/off. Additionally, environment data(the temperature, etc.) is sent to cloud via MQTT. See Greenhouse CO2_controller_instructions.pdf for more detailed description of the project. The main controller board is LPC1549.
